<h1>Xiangqi Cloud Database API Documentation</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Brief</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xiangqi Cloud Database(aka. "CDB") API has two parts, first is to probe the database, which can be achieved by reqesting CDB's HTTP-based RESTful API.</p>
<p>Then, as an extension to the existing UCI engine protocol, a few new options can be added so that the GUI and the engine can work better when handling results from CDB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>RESTful API Interface</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CDB's API access point is: http://www.chessdb.cn/chessdb.php?action=[<i>ACTION</i>]{&[<i>OPTION1</i>]=[<i>VALUE1</i>]...&[<i>OPTIONn</i>]=[<i>VALUEn</i>]}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In which the fields are defined as:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ACTION: Action type, for example, query all known moves (queryall), suggest a move (query / querybest), request analysis (queue), etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OPTION & VALUE: Options, for example, position to query (board) and forbidden moves (ban), etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Query All Known Moves (queryall)</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mandatory: board, set to the FEN format encoding of the position to query, e.g. &board=rnbakabnr/9/1c5c1/p1p1p1p1p/9/9/P1P1P1P1P/1C5C1/9/RNBAKABNR w</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Optional: ban, set to a list of forbidden moves, separated by "|", e.g. &ban=move:c3c4|move:b2e2|move:c0e2, default is empty, allowing all moves</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Optional: showall, set to false if unknown moves should be omitted, e.g. &showall=0 or &showall=1, default is 0, only return known moves</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Optional: egtbmetric, set to desired EGTB metric, e.g. &egtbmetric=dtc or &egtbmetric=dtm, default is dtm, using DTM tablebases</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Optional: learn, set to whether automatic learning should be enabled, e.g. &learn=0 or &learn=1, default is 1, enabling automatic learning</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Return: move data separated by "|", of which each field is separated by ",", fields may contain "move", "score", "rank", "winrate" and "note"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the position is invalid, "invalid board" is returned, if the position is unknown, "unknown" is returned, if the position is a checkmate or stalemate, "checkmate" or "stalemate" is returned</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Suggest Best, Random or Candidate Moves (querybest/query/querysearch)</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mandatory: board, set to the FEN format encoding of the position to query, e.g. &board=rnbakabnr/9/1c5c1/p1p1p1p1p/9/9/P1P1P1P1P/1C5C1/9/RNBAKABNR w</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Optional: ban, set to a list of forbidden moves, separated by "|", e.g. &ban=move:c3c4|move:b2e2|move:c0e2, default is empty, allowing all moves</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Optional: endgame, set to whether only EGTB data should be returned, e.g. &endgame=0 or &endgame=1, default is 0, all data are returned</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Optional: learn, set to whether automatic learning should be enabled, e.g. &learn=0 or &learn=1, default is 1, enabling automatic learning</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Return: move data separated by "|", of which a normal move are returned as move:[<i>MOVE</i>], an EGTB move is returned as egtb:[<i>MOVE</i>], a candidate move is returned as search:[<i>MOVE</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Candidate moves are a list of moves that may require further processing, such as sending them as "searchmoves" to an engine</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the position is invalid, "invalid board" is returned, if no satisfing move is found, "nobestmove" is returned</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Optional: ban, set to a list of forbidden moves, separated by "|", e.g. &ban=move:c3c4|move:b2e2|move:c0e2, default is empty, allowing all moves</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>UCI Extensions</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usually, only GUIs should send API queries to CDB, engines do not need to make any network queries.</p>
<p>Preferably GUIs can inform the engines about the information returned from CDB via UCI, for example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Opening Move Suggestion (bookmove)</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While sending "go" commands to engines, append "bookmove [<i>MOVE</i>]" to suggest a move from opening book, engines can decide whether to immediately return "bestmove [<i>MOVE</i>]" or start their own search ignoring the suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This option is ignored in analysis mode (go infinite) or pondering (go ponder) and must be placed before "searchmoves"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Principal Variation Hints (hint)</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During searches, sending "hint score [<i>SCORE</i>] depth [<i>DEPTH</i>] pv [<i>MOVE1</i>]{... [<i>MOVEn</i>]}" to inform engines about known principal variations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>EGTB Move Suggestion (egtbmove)</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While sending "go" commands to engines, append "egtbmove [<i>MOVE</i>]" to suggest a move from EGTB, engines can decide whether to immediately return "bestmove [<i>MOVE</i>]" or start their own search ignoring the suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This option is ignored in analysis mode (go infinite) or pondering (go ponder) and must be placed before "searchmoves"</p>
